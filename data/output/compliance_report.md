### Query: How are passwords managed?

**Policy Section**: 4.5

**Response**: The provided Information Security Policy document outlines the management of passwords as follows:

- Passwords are required for access to any system, in addition to a unique user ID.
- Passwords must meet complexity requirements, including being at least eight characters long for normal users.
- Passwords must be communicated to users in a secure manner.
- One-time passwords must be used and changed upon the first login attempt where the application supports this feature.
- Community strings for Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) must be defined as something other than the standard defaults.
- Users are not allowed to share their passwords with any other user.
- Passwords must not be stored by users in clear text on the computer system.

This password management policy appears to be compliant with PCI-DSS and ISO 27001 standards, as it addresses password complexity, secure password communication, and password storage. However, a more detailed analysis of the policy's implementation and enforcement is required to confirm full compliance.

**Compliance Status**: Non-Compliant
