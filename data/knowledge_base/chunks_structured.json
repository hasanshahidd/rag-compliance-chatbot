In white-box testing an internal perspective of the system, as well as programming skills, are used to design test cases.. 2. Grey-box testing: Grey Box testing is testing technique performed with limited information about the internal functionality of the system which includes but not limited network, software and infrastructure etc. 3. Black-box testing: Blackbox penetration test requires no prior information about the target network or application and is actually performed keeping it as a real-world hacker attack scenario.
